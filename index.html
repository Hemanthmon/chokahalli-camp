            <h3>How we work with our patients?</h3>
        </div>
        <h4>We have divided patients into 4 categories</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Category 1: Spectacle Correction.</b></li>
            <p>
                In this category, our experienced optometrists will meticulously examine your eyes. If everything appears in optimal condition, you will be cleared to go, ensuring a quick and hassle-free experience.
            </p>

            <li><b>Category 2: Instant Spectacle Provision.</b></li>
            <p>
                Patients falling into this category will undergo a comprehensive eye examination. If corrective lenses are deemed necessary, our skilled optometrists will provide you with spectacles on the spot, ensuring immediate visual improvement.
            </p>

            <li><b>Category 3: Long Vision Defect Correction.</b></li>
            <p>
                For patients in this category, our optometrists will conduct a detail eye examination. If a long vision defect is detected, we will record the necessary readings. Spectacles will be provided on Sunday, 28th January 2024. Rest assured, we will keep in touch with you to coordinate the delivery of your spectacles.
            </p>

            <li><b>Category 4</b></li>
            <p>
                In Category 4, our optometrists will carefully assess your eyes. If any issues are identified, you will be referred for a comprehensive eye examination by our ophthalmology specialists. In cases where further evaluation of the retina is required, our assistants will assist you with eye drops. Please anticipate a 20-minute wait before the retina examination.

                For patients requiring advanced treatments, operations, or laser procedures, these will be conducted at our state-of-the-art BW Lions Hospital in Bangalore. We are committed to stay in close contact with individuals who may require such interventions to ensure seamless coordination and support throughout the entire process.

                Our goal is to provide top-notch eye care, combining expertise and compassion for a healthier and clearer vision. If you have any concerns or questions about your eye health, our dedicated team is here to assist you every step of the way.</p>
                
                <p>Operations, laser treatments, or advanced treatments will be provided in Bangalore at BW Lions Hospital for patients in Category 4 experiencing eye problems. We will be in contact with those requiring surgery. Please ensure to maintain optimal blood sugar levels and blood pressure. If you do not have optimal blood sugar levels and blood pressure, we will not consider you for the operations, as doctors will not recommend you for surgery. The hospital bus will transport patients to Bangalore on Monday, January 29, 2024. It will arrive at the toll gate near SFS Church in Chintamani.</p>
